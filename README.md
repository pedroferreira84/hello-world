IÂ´m Pedro Ferreira and I'm a Scientific Researcher. I concluded my Master course in Informatics Engineering in December 2010 at Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto (FCUP). My Master thesis was in the Breast Cancer field and was entitled "Applying Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Breast Cancer".

From 2010 to 2018 I was a Research Fellow at CRACS-INESC TEC in the areas of Data Mining and Machine Learning applied to clinical data.

Currently I am a member of IBMC/i3S.
